# Python Turtle Games

For these projects, we talked through code elements as a class for v1 and v2 and then students worked more independently for v3 and v4.
Most of us are using [trinket.io](https://trinket.io/)
I have two students that prefer IDLE, but every once in a while we notice slight differences in the two (for example, with trinket.io you can hold down an arrow key and continuously move, but with IDLE you must repeatedly press the arrow key).

## Turtle Game v1
Here is a student project for v1.0

We originally had a requirement that you had to collect the coin, delete the coin, and then touch the goal. Once the player distance to the coin was below a mininum, we would delete coin, but this would case an error when the code looped around and once again tried to determine the distance to the coin. We used try/except to handle this, but some of the students struggled with try/except, so I modified the project so that there is no goal and you simply have to touch the coin to win v1.

## Turtle Game v2
Here is a student's v2

Some students kept it really simple with Turtles named p1, p2, bad1, bad2, coin, and goal. Other students created arrays of badguys and arrays of coins. It was much easier to delete a coin from an array and not worry about getting an error.

## Turtle Game v3
Here is a student's v3

Some games switched back to a single player, but others stayed 2-player. The core idea with v3 is that the game resets when you reach the goal and gets progressively harder each time (adding more enemies and speeding up the game slightly).

## Turtle Game v4
Here is one student's v4 = ( Use WASD to move )


Here is another v4


We added a Wall class and images.
